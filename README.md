# leedsdown

A template repository showing how you can use [leedsdown-theme](https://github.com/harryclegg/leedsdown-theme) to write a thesis using Rmarkdown.

The theme is a submodule, which means future updates can be distributed easily.

The content folder (and, to a limited extent, the index.Rmd file) should be all that you need to change.
